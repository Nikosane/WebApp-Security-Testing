# Introduction to Web Application Security

Web application security is a crucial aspect of modern software development. Vulnerabilities in web applications can be exploited by attackers to compromise user data, bypass authentication mechanisms, or inject malicious scripts.

This project focuses on common web vulnerabilities such as:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
- **File Upload Vulnerabilities**

This repository is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate these vulnerabilities using intentionally vulnerable applications like **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).
