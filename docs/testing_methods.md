# Web Application Security Testing Methods

There are various methods for testing web applications for vulnerabilities, including manual testing, automated scanning, and penetration testing with tools.

## Manual Testing
- Manually inputting malicious data in form fields (e.g., `' OR '1'='1` for SQLi).
- Intercepting HTTP requests to test for vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.

## Automated Testing
- Using tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Burp Suite** to scan for vulnerabilities automatically.

## Penetration Testing Tools
- **Burp Suite**: Intercept and modify HTTP requests, perform scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated penetration testing tool with various scanning features.
